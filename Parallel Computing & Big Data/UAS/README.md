# This Folder is for the Final Exam Code Reproduction (https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering)

#### Introduction  

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of collaborative filtering recommender systems, from memory-based collaborative filtering to more advanced machine learning algorithms.
It starts by implementing basics collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based collaborative filering also known as user-to-user collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering (item-to-item collaborative filtering). 
This repository also goes through dimensionality reduction based recommendation system. It presents models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Matrix Factorization (MF), Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Explainable Matrix Factorization (EMF).
